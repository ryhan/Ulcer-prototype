Ulcer-prototype
===============

Prototype Ulcer Detection/Evaluation/Analysis tool for iPad

## Getting Started


### Local Setup

Clone `https://github.com/ryhan/Ulcer-prototype`, and open `index.html`.

Push any changes to the `master` branch, and sync with the main repository.

### Production

Our work is publicly visible at `http://ryhan.github.com/Ulcer-prototype/`.

Once master has been checked by the team, sync with the `gh-pages` branch to make it publicly visible. Be very careful, as any changes you make could potentially break our demos.
